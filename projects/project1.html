                                                    <span>This keychain was my first print for the Engineering class at Brandeis (ENGR 11A). 
                                                    To start this project, I downloaded the 3mf file from the link provided in the 
                                                    project guidelines document. Once I had the file downloaded, I opened it in 
                                                    PrusaSlicer (the CAM software recommended for the Prusa Mini+) and checked if 
                                                    the profile was correct for the settings I wanted. For this print, I used my 
                                                    custom 0.2mm layer height profile designed for speed while still having high print 
                                                    quality. To do this, I modified the existing 0.2 SPEED profile in PrusaSlicer with the 
                                                    following values:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Layer Height: 0.2mm</li>
                                                        <li>Print Speed: 140mm/s</li>
                                                        <li>External Perimeter Speed: 80mm/s</li>
                                                        <li>Infill Density: 10%</li>
                                                        <li>Infill Pattern: Gyroid</li>
                                                        <li>Bridges: 50mm/s</li>
                                                        <li>Supports: None</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    The most intricate part of this print was the color change for the letters and icon in 
                                                    the keychain. This color change happened 11 layers in to the print (about 10 minutes). 
                                                    The overall print time for this object was 13 minutes which was a perfect time to remind 
                                                    myself of all the intricacies of 3d printing after the month off from break.

                                                    The torture test was the second part of the project. The purpose of this print is to test the 
                                                    limits of physical printer being used. For this print, I was once again using a Prusa Mini + 
                                                    with my custom print profile. The model that I used (shown to the right) uses many different 
                                                    testing techniques to ensure accuracy of the printer. The different features are:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Overhang test with faces at overhangs different by 10 degrees</li>
                                                        <li>Dimensional accuracy test with cubes of varying sizes with preset and known dimensions</li>
                                                        <li>Cooling test with a thin tower that will not stand straight without proper cooling</li>
                                                        <li>Bridging test with overhangs between two supports (two different tests of different lengths)</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    Additional tests that are performed with the elements mentioned above are:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Stringing test with a series of towers with different distances between them</li>
                                                        <li>Retraction test with a series of towers with different retraction settings</li>
                                                        <li>Small feature test with a series of small features that are hard to print</li>
                                                        <li>Seam test with sharp corners to show where layers start and end</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    The overall print time for this torture test was 1 hour and 30 minutes. This print was a 
                                                    great way to test the limits of the printer and see how well it was calibrated. The print 
                                                    came out very well with almost no noticeable artifacts. The issues I was able to find 
                                                    were the 80° overhang test where there were some sagging pieces of filament because it 
                                                    didn’t have anything to hold on to. The other issue I found was on the bridging tests. 
                                                    These filament sagging issues were also due to filament being printed in the air.

                                                    I am very happy with the results of this print and I am excited to continue printing.

                                                    Beacuse I already had a github student account, I was able to create a new repository for the project and
                                                    start building the website hosted on github pages. I used the template "Personal" from bootstrap because 
                                                    I liked the colors and overall aesthetic. Due to my previous experience with React, HTML, and CSS, customizing 
                                                    the template was easy and fun! I hope you enjoy the website!
