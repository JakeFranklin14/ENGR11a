                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/SketchCentaur.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                                            The first step of this assignment was to find 2-3 existing models that 
                                                            I wanted to combine into one. I thought it would be fun to create a centaur! 
                                                            The first model I found was the horse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2785163">(thingaverse model 2785163)</a>. 
                                                            This model was a simple start to my project. The next thing I found was the person 
                                                            to be the top half of the centaur. The model I used was 
                                                            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:661993">(thingaverse model 661993)</a> (man_standing_6).
                                                            To combine the models, I opened each of them in tinkercad and made the following cuts using the hole tool.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- Horse No Head -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/HorseNoHead.png" alt="..." />
                                                            The first model I opened was the horse. I needed to cut the head off in order to create
                                                            space for the person. I used the box hole tool in tinkercad to do this. I positioned the box 
                                                            where I wanted to cut and grouped it with the horse. This left me with a horse with no head.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- Person No Legs -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/PersonNoLegs.png" alt="..." />
                                                            The next model I needed to modify was the person. I needed to cut the legs off in order to attach
                                                            it to the horse. I used the box hole tool again to do this. I positioned the box where I wanted to cut
                                                            and grouped it with the person. This left me with a person with no legs.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- First Slice -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/centaurNeedsRepair.png" alt="..." />
                                                            Once I had the models combined into one, I was able to use the tinkercad export to STL feature to download my new ‘Remixed’ 
                                                            model and open it in PrusaSlicer. I used my standard 0.2mm layer height profile that I used for my previous project to slice 
                                                            this model. After slicing, I previewed the layers and noticed that the STL had very thin walls at the head of the centaur.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- First Repair -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/meshmixerPre.png" alt="..." />
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/meshmixerPost.png" alt="..." />
                                                            I tried multiple different different options to repair this model. The first thing I tried was an online STL repair which did 
                                                            nothing. The next thing I tried was using Meshmixer to repair the model. Meshmixer was able to find the issue parts as seen 
                                                            in the image to the right. Also seen to the right is the poor job meshmixer did to fix the model. I was not able to find a way to
                                                            fix the thin walls in meshmixer so I had to move to the next option.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- Second Repair -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right; margin-top: 10px;" src="../assets/Project2/NetfabbCentaur.png" alt="..." />
                                                            Because the Meshmixer repair didnt work, I had to try yet another repair method. The next thing I tried was the PrusaSlicer 
                                                            STL repair algorithm which made some improvements to the model but did not fully fix the hole seen in the head in the images 
                                                            above. Despite some improvements being made, they were not up to my liking. My last mesh repair option was using Netfabb. 
                                                            This was recommended to me by Professor Roy who had used this tool to repair many models in the past. I was hopeful that 
                                                            this would work, however, my model appeared to be beyond repair.

                                                            To stick with my idea of a centaur, I decided to find a different head model to use. The bust I went with was of Albert 
                                                            Einstein <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:966908">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:966908</a>.
                                                            This model needed no cutting to work with the centaur that I had created, however, I did need to cut 
                                                            the head off the existing centaur so I could replace the head.

                                                            After all my testing and experimenting with different repair tools, I was finally able to create a model 
                                                            that would print. I sliced the model with the same settings as before and was sent it to the printer! The total print time 
                                                            for this model was 2 hours and 40 minutes as seen in the image to the right.

                                                            Overall, this first part of the project was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about different errors and corruptions that
                                                            can occur in STL models. Previously, I had only ever thought that STL models could have holes, or be solid. I never
                                                            knew that STL models had walls that could be thin or thick. Having this hands on learning experience not only allowed
                                                            me to expand my knowledge of STL files and models, but also taught me multiple different ways to repair them.

                                                            For part of the project, I again needed 2-3 existing 3d models to combine together into a new one, but this 
                                                            time I needed to combine them using Autodesk Fusion. For this remix, I chose an already remixed file of 
                                                            fred the frog but the rock <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5158215">(thingaverse model 5158215)</a>
                                                            and a cowboy hat <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1709802">(thingaverse model 1709802)</a>. 
                                                            Once I found the models, I downloaded them and imported them into Fusion. The two models I used did 
                                                            not have too many triangles so luckily my computer was able to quickly and easily convert them both 
                                                            to bodies as seen to the right.

                                                            Once I had the models imported, I was able to use the combine tool to combine them into one. I used the
                                                            join option to combine them as i did not need to cut out any pieces of either model in order for them 
                                                            to fit together. I positioned the hat on the frog and used the combine tool to create a new
                                                            body with both the hat and the frog.

                                                            Once I had the models combined, I was able to export the model as an STL and open it in PrusaSlicer. 
                                                            I used my standard 0.2mm layer height profile that I used for my previous project to slice this model. 
                                                            The total print time for this object was around 3 and a half hours.

                                                            I am very happy with the final result of this print. I am really like the sizing of the hat in respect
                                                            to the frog. The one thing this model revealed to me is that i need to work on my z-seam positioning.
                                                            As seen in the image to the right, the z-seam is very visible on the side of the model. Some ways I 
                                                            can improve this is staggering the z-seam which would place it in staggered positions each layer.
                                                            Doing this would improve the overall appearance of the model as well as the strength of certain models 
                                                            in the future.
