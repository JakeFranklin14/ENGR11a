                                                            The first step in this project was to read through the instructions to get a full sense of what was 
                                                            happening. I would classify the manual as being split into 3 different sections; Introduction and 
                                                            overview, Verbal instructions, and Visual instructions. As a visual learner, I appreciated the 
                                                            pictures to help guide me along the instructions. Each step of the assembly manual had an image 
                                                            which helped me place the components in the right spot and words to ensure I had chosen the correct 
                                                            components. Overall, I really liked the instruction manual and I was able to assemble a car in one day!

                                                            cool to learn the differences between the two processes. Luckily, Seth had done some soldering before 
                                                            so we were not going in blind. The general information for the equipment used is the following:

                                                            The first step of assembly was to solder all the electrical components to the main PCB. To do this, we 
                                                            each took turns soldering the parts to the board, ensuring that all contacts were made securely.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- Worm Gears -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right;" src="../assets/Project3/wormGear.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                                            The next step was to make sure the worm gears for the wheels were engaging properly. 
                                                            To do this, we needed to adjust the placement of the worm gear on the shaft of the motor, 
                                                            either moving it up or down depending on the engagement issues. The other method of fixing 
                                                            engagement issues was to push the wheels closer to the motors. We needed both of these 
                                                            solutions in order to get proper engagement of the wheels to the motors.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <!-- Overall -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            Once we had the robot assembled and the motors working, we needed to tune the potentiometers. 
                                                            Doing this allowed us to adjust the sensitivity of the light sensors that detect the line beneath the robot. 
                                                            After much testing, we managed to get the tuning perfect so the robot could follow the line as expected. 
                                                            As you can see in the video below, after assembling and tuning the robot, it was successfully able to follow a

                                                        <p>

                                                            Once the box had finished printing, we realized we got some of the tolerances wrong. 
                                                            I then decided to upload an image of the PCB to Fusion 360 as a canvas and trace out 
                                                            the board so I could build around the PCB. This worked because the length dimension 
                                                            that we had measured from the physical robot was correct so I was able to scale the 
                                                            image proportionally and make sure the length of the PCB in the image matched the 
                                                            dimension we got from the robot. The result was the model seen to the right which 
                                                            has all the big parts built in so we were able to build around that for the future cases.

                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>

                                                            Once the scaling was done, I made a simple case for the robot. I wanted to start simple so I decided 
                                                            to make a cybertruck. This idea was simple because of its low-poly design meaning it is built from 
                                                            very few triangles. To get the shape, I projected a side profile of a cybertruck as a canvas onto the 
                                                            center plane of the long side of the scale model in fusion. I was then able to trace the outline and 
                                                            extrude the sketch both directions to the proper width. Then, I used the combine-as-cut tool to cut out 
                                                            the motors and the wheel arches from the case to ensure they would not get stuck when putting the case 
                                                            on the robot. The final result was a very simple design that was effective at covering the electronics 
                                                            while still giving me access to the power button.

                                                            The second case we 3D printed was primarily designed by Seth. This case was of a horse because it fit all 
                                                            the requirements needed for the case design and was an entertaining project. To design this, we started 
                                                            with an existing model of a horse and scaled up each of the dimensions to fit the model of the car I had 
                                                            designed in fusion that I talked about earlier. Once the dimensions were correct, we used the cut tool to 
                                                            cut out slots for the car to sit in the legs of the horse. We then printed out that first iteration and 
                                                            discovered that we were unable to get the car into the slots without breaking the model. We cut two of the 
                                                            legs off to make sure our tolerances were correct and then resliced the model two more times, split in half, 
                                                            once with pins to reconnect the pieces and once with magnets. In the end, the horse with magnets was the most 
                                                            successful iteration of the second case and was a very entertaining project.

                                                            The last part of this project was to laser cut multiple cases/enclosures for the 
                                                            line following robot. The first step of this process was to learn how to make basic 
                                                            finger joint boxes in fusion. After following the recommended tutorial, I ended up 
                                                            with a box that was able to be laser cut on the machine in the classroom. The recommended 
                                                            tutorial had dimensions they used, however I used the dimensions above that we measured 
                                                            from the physical robot so we could have a very basic case for the car. The hole seen 
                                                            in the image was not part of the tutorial, but I added it so we could have a way to access 
                                                            the power switch with the case on the car.

                                                    <!-- step 2 -->
                                                    <p>
                                                        <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right;" src="../assets/Project3/boxinlb.png" alt="..." />
                                                        The laser cutter cuts out of a flat sheet of material (acrylic in this case) so we needed the finger 
                                                        joints to hold the sides together. Once all the pieces were cut out, we used hot glue to secure them 
                                                        all together because the joints were too loose to stay together by itself. Once assembled, we realized 
                                                        that the case was slightly too long, so we shortened the length of it and cut it again. This time, we 
                                                        forgot to add the power button hole back in, so we had to follow a different process to cut out the hole 
                                                        after the box was assembled.

                                                    <!-- step 3 -->
                                                     <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            <img class="write-up-image" onclick="openModal(this.src)" style="float: right;" src="../assets/Project3/engravingcar.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                                            After that box was cut, we cut the hole in it and the car fit perfectly! But the box was too simple 
                                                            for my liking so I decided to engrave the word car, because it was supposed to be the exact opposite 
                                                            of the chaos of the horse we 3d printed. In order to engrave car on the assembled car, I needed to 
                                                            refocus the laser cutter to the higher face than the regular flat sheets typically used. I refocused 
                                                            the the beam to engrave on the top surface of the box and proceed with the engraving.

                                                    <!-- step 4 -->
                                                    <div class="row">
                                                        <p>
                                                            The end result was a snug fitting case that allowed for visibility to all the components and
                                                             sensors that was visually appealing and met all the requirements for the design project.
