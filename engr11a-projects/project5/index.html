                                                <p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        The design and prototyping process for creating accessible door accessories has primarily been testing existing models found online and interviewing some users in one of our target demographics to understand their likes and dislikes of the existing solutions.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        In our interviews, we received many pieces of feedback, positive and negative, all helping us refine our idea. One of our primary takeaways from these interviews was that users did not want to have something that needs to be put on and taken off every time they want to open the door. However, having something portable would be nice in situations where the door knobs are sticky and the doors are heavy.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        Another takeaway from this process was that being able to open a door with your elbow is very useful—not just for those with mobility issues, but also when your hands are full. From this feedback, we decided to make sure the handle would stick out far enough to ensure a person could apply sufficient pulling force to turn and open the door.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        Not all of the feedback was positive. In one interview, we were told the handle did not feel secure on the door. This is particularly important, as the handle needs to be able to secure to all kinds of door knobs while still being easily removable when necessary. Another comment about the stability of the handle was less about its attachment to the door and more about the security when grabbing it. It was suggested we add a curve to the end of the handle, making an almost L-shape, to ensure a hand cannot slide off while twisting it. This shape would also provide a bumper for elbow operation.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        Overall, the feedback we received was very helpful in furthering our design and our understanding of the problem at hand.

                                                      <p>
                                                        We made some changes to our How Might We statements while collecting and analyzing feedback on our initial prototype. We found that our initial design already fit several different door knob shapes, but a more pressing issue was that it could be easily pulled or pushed out of place.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        We also decided that the durability of metal screws outweighed the concern of accessibility of materials, since most students at Brandeis who would possibly be 3D printing this design would already be in a maker space to do so. In this case, we would want to ensure that those spaces were stocked with the additional materials needed to assemble our door knob adapter.
                                                      </p>
                                                    
                                                      <p>
                                                        Additionally, we still want to work with DCL to ensure that our design is safe and compliant with any rules and regulations. If possible, we want to make it an option to semi-permanently install this design in your dorm room! The last change we made was a shift towards durability. Whether by using a stronger material or modifying our original design to be more sturdy, we want to ensure that these adapters can be used for an extended period of time if required.

                                                            Our final idea is an attachment for a standard door knob that can be 3d printed and assembled with
                                                            standard, off the shelf hardware to convert a door knob to a lever-style door handle. Our design will allow
                                                            for easy installation and removable and will comply with the safety regulations of the state of Massachusetts.
